//! CLI-specific glue for routing transactions through a Squads multisig vault.
//!
//! This module owns ncn's transaction-orchestration policy:
//!
//! * the [`RoutedOutcome`] type returned by every Squads-aware `send_*` helper,
//! * [`route_via_squads`], the synchronous routing core that wraps user instructions in a
//!   Squads `vault_transaction_create` + `proposal_create` pair, retrying on
//!   transaction-index collisions,
//! * the [`effective_signer`] helper that swaps the local signer for the vault PDA when
//!   running in Squads mode.
//!
//! The ncn CLI uses the blocking Anchor client and owns a tokio runtime for snapshot
//! processing, so it deliberately avoids building on the shared async router (which would
//! require nesting runtimes) and instead drives the Squads flow against the blocking RPC
//! client directly.
//!
//! The Squads-compatibility decision ("can a vault PDA satisfy this command's on-chain
//! signer-identity check?") is **not** modeled here — it lives next to the clap
//! [`Commands`](crate::Commands) enum in `main.rs` (`squads_refusal_for`) and is enforced
//! up front before any handler runs. The router therefore trusts its caller; the routing
//! call is unconditional once the gate has passed.
